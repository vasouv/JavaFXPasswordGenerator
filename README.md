JavaFXPasswordGenerator
=======================

This is my simple Password Generator writtern in JavaFX.

You can choose whether to have numbers, lowercase or uppercase letters, and special characters (!@#$ etc)

TO-DO:
- Add copy-to-clipboard functionality
- A list with the previously generated passwords (maybe)
- Some GUI fixes
- Probably add CSS

BUG:
If you don't choose a certain length for the password, it doesn't default to the one I've set. I'll try to fix it.

CONTRIBUTING:
You're more than welcome to change/fix/improve my code, after all I'm an amateur programmer trying to learn :)
