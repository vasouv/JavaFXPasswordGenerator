JavaFXPasswordGenerator
=======================

This is my simple Password Generator written in JavaFX.

You can choose whether to have numbers, lowercase or uppercase letters, and special characters (!@#$ etc)

TO-DO:
- Some GUI fixes
- Probably add CSS
- Reverse the previous password list, so older passwords move down and new ones are on top

BUG:
If you don't choose a certain length for the password, it doesn't default to the one I've set. I'll try to fix it.

CONTRIBUTING:
You're more than welcome to change/fix/improve my code, after all I'm an amateur programmer trying to learn :)
